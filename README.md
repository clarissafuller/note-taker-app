# Note Taker Starter Code

## The Module 11 Challenge is to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

This project came with starter code with a pre-built front end and the goal of the homework was to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
